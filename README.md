# PoseRepTracker

### One of the Coolest Project I’ve Ever Made!

This is a **real-time pose estimation project** that tracks your body landmarks using a webcam and **counts your exercise repetitions** based on arm movements.

I seriously enjoyed this project a lot — moving my hands **up and down**, **to and fro**, and honestly, **each line of code felt like magic!** Watching the angles change in real-time and building this from scratch was such a satisfying experience.
